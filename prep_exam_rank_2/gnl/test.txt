In this example, we first open a file named "example.txt" in read mode using the fopen() function. If the file can't be opened, we print an error message and return 1 to indicate failure.
Next, we declare a character array called buffer that will be used to store the data we read from the file. We then use the fread() function to read the first 99 characters from the file into the buffer array. The sizeof(char) parameter indicates that we are reading individual characters, and the return value of fread() tells us how many characters were actually read.
After reading the characters, we add a null terminator to the end of the buffer array to treat it as a string. Finally, we print the number of characters read and the contents of the buffer array using the printf() function, and then close the file using the fclose() function.
Note that there are other functions in C that can be used to read data from files, such as fgets() and fscanf(), but the read() function is typically used for low-level input/output operations and may not be the best choice for reading data from text files.
